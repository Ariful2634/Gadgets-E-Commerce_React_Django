#### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Node.js: [Installation Guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- npm (Node Package Manager): It comes bundled with Node.js.
- Git: [Installation Guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

#### Installation

To set up a React project with Vite, follow these steps:

1. **Create a New Project:**

   Initialize a new Vite project with the `create-vite` command, using one of the available plugins:

   - Using Babel for Fast Refresh (Recommended):

     ```bash
     npx create-vite@latest my-react-app --template react
     ```

   - Using SWC for Fast Refresh:

     ```bash
     npx create-vite@latest my-react-app --template react-swc
     ```

   Replace `my-react-app` with your preferred project name.

2. **Navigate to Your Project:**

   Change your current directory to the newly created project:

   ```bash
   cd my-react-app
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   Use npm to install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

#### Usage

Now that your React + Vite project is set up, you can start using it:

1. **Development Server:**

   Start the development server with hot-reloading by running:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will open a development server and display a URL in the console. Open that URL in your web browser to see your React app.

2. **Build for Production:**

   To build your project for production, use:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   The optimized production build will be available in the `dist` directory.

#### Configuration

The default Vite configuration for React should work seamlessly with the chosen Fast Refresh plugin. If you need to make custom configurations, you can do so by editing the `vite.config.js` file. Refer to the [official Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/config/) for detailed configuration options.

#### Technologies Used

This project integrates several technologies:

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
